# erc20-foundation

This is foundationId togglable ERC20 compatible token.  

<p>The code has not been fully tested.  Be careful.
<br>The code has not been audited for security bugs.  Be careful. 

<p>The ideal approach is to force FoundationId to be used from the start and/or to not have things toggable.  Allowing users to move from an address based system to a foundationId and allowing backward compatibility brings up a number of ways for serious bugs to enter the codebase.
